#### Added
- PHP 8.1 support

#### Changed
- Redundant unions are not reduced to minimal type as eagerly.
- Added additional logging when indexing.
- Diagnostics limited to parse errors only for non-file URIs.

## [1.7.1 - 2021-05-02]

#### Changed
- Updated stubs

#### Fixed
- phpdoc `double` normalised to `float`.

- Signature help offset label support.

When set to `single` a rename of a namespace will only affect the symbols defined in that single file. This is the equivalent of a single 'move class' operation. Previously renaming a namespace would affect all symbols that shared that namespace across multiple files. Setting to the value to `all` will produce the old behaviour. **[Premium](https://intelephense.com)**
